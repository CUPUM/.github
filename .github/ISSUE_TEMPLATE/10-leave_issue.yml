      ## Overview
      Leaves are managed according to the University's regulation and bylaws, which hold precedence on any internal process. For more detailed information about internal processes, please refer to [*dedicated aide-memoires* on the general/ repo](https://github.com/CUPUM/general/tree/main/leaves). For information about the University's regulation, check out your union's Collective Agreement and MonUdeM.

      Leaves concern any regulated leaves:
      - Vacation
      - Sick leave
      - Medical appointments
      - Unpaid time off
      - Other (based on Collective Agreement)

      As well as non-regulated leaves:
      - Prolongated absence from office (more than 2 continuous days)
      - Work trip (external events, training and teaching)

      As a general rule, leaves should:
      1. Respect the university's regulation
      2. Not impact projects and teams negatively
      3. Be notified ahead of time to insure project coordination
      4. Be taken within deadlines (for vacation time)
      5. Be taken as soon as possible (for overtime)
