## References

If you are uncertain of the process prescribed by the school for the purchase planned here, refer to the university's [**documentation on making a purchase request**](https://approvisionnement.umontreal.ca/faire-une-demande-dachat/faire-une-demande-dachat/#moins-de-25-000). Although it can often simplify the task, it is not always necessary to limit the product choices to a pre-approved provider (such as INSO).
